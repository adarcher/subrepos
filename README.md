# Git Subrepos

Naive alternative to git submodules that doesn't require a seperate install.

Ever use a submodule and find that it doesn't require a specific tag, and you'd like to just reference the current branch HEAD.  But, when you change the submodule in it's own repo, your own repo complains and forces you to commit a hash change?

I hate that.  So, I made this.  It's way more work than I should have put into it.  Once I get off my "old-man" subborn soap-box, I'll probably retire this as a waste of time.
